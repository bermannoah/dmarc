# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are released for the latest published version. Older versions
are not patched; the fix ships in a new release.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.11.x  | ✅ |
| < 0.11  | ❌ |

Before 1.0, a security fix may ship in a minor version that also contains
breaking changes. The ChangeLog marks breaking changes explicitly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting][advisories] on
https://github.com/bermannoah/dmarcator. Please do not open a public issue.

Include, as far as you can:

- the version affected, and the Ruby and `resolv` versions,
- the input that triggers the problem (a DMARC record, report, or domain name),
- what you expected and what happened,
- whether the DNS transport was plaintext, DNS over HTTPS, or DNS over TLS.

You will get an acknowledgement, an assessment, and a coordinated disclosure
date. Credit is given in the ChangeLog unless you ask otherwise.

## What this library treats as untrusted

Everything it parses or resolves is untrusted, and the design assumes so:

- **DMARC records** come from DNS and are parsed by a grammar with input
  bounds; error messages echoing input are truncated.
- **DMARC XML reports** are untrusted documents. They are parsed with network
  access disabled (`NONET`), size-capped, and rejected on malformed input.
- **Domain names** are validated before reaching the resolver.
- **DNS responses** are validated by the encrypted transports (transaction id,
  question, truncation bit), and TLS certificates are always verified.

Lookup failures fail closed: a transport error raises
`DMARCator::ResolutionError` rather than being reported as "no DMARC record",
so a blocked or degraded resolver cannot silently result in no policy being
enforced.

## In scope

- Parser bugs reachable from a DMARC record, an XML report, or a domain name:
  crashes, unbounded memory or CPU, entity expansion, unsafe reflection.
- Transport bugs: TLS verification bypass, response spoofing not caught by the
  id/question checks, request smuggling, unbounded response buffering.
- Silent fail-open behaviour: any path where a failure is reported as an
  absent record.

## Out of scope

- Vulnerabilities in `parslet`, `nokogiri`, or Ruby itself. Report those
  upstream; the library's load-time guard for known `resolv` issues is a
  warning, not a substitute for patching.
- The *policy* decisions of an application built on the library, such as
  whether to fail open on `DMARCator::ResolutionError`.
- Misconfiguration of the caller's resolver, or the trustworthiness of a
  third-party DNS provider chosen by the caller.

## Hardening already applied

The ChangeLog records these, and the README documents the current behaviour:
XXE and entity limits, report and record size caps, `pct`/`ri` range checks,
duplicate-tag rejection, strict `mailto:`-only report URIs, DNS name
validation, TLS verification, and the `resolv` CVE guard.
