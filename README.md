DMARCator is a Ruby library for parsing and querying [DMARC] records.

[DMARC] policies are published as DNS TXT records at `_dmarc.<domain>`. This
library parses those records into a structured `DMARCator::Record`, queries them
directly through Ruby's `Resolv` DNS client, and parses the XML aggregate
reports those policies generate.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "dmarcator"
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself:

```sh
gem install dmarcator
```

The gem is loaded via:

```ruby
require "dmarcator"
```

## Example

Parse a DMARC record:

```ruby
require "dmarcator"

record = DMARCator::Record.parse(
  "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:d@rua.agari.com; ruf=mailto:d@ruf.agari.com; fo=1"
)

record.v
# => :DMARC1

record.p
# => :reject

record.adkim
# => :r

record.aspf
# => :r

record.fo
# => ["1"]

record.pct
# => 100

record.rf
# => :afrf

record.ri
# => 86400

record.rua
# => [#<DMARCator::Uri ... @uri=#<URI::MailTo mailto:d@rua.agari.com>, @size=nil, @unit=nil>]

record.ruf
# => [#<DMARCator::Uri ... @uri=#<URI::MailTo mailto:d@ruf.agari.com>, @size=nil, @unit=nil>]

record.sp
# => :reject
```

Query the DMARC record for a domain:

```ruby
record = DMARCator::Record.lookup("twitter.com")
# => #<DMARCator::Record ... @p=:reject, @rua=[...], ...>
```

Domains must be ASCII (A-labels): pass punycode such as
`xn--mnchen-3ya.de` rather than `münchen.de`. A lookup failure raises
`DMARCator::ResolutionError`; `nil` only means the domain genuinely has no
DMARC record.

## Lookup APIs

The lookup methods are named after what they return:

| Method | Returns | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `DMARCator.txt_records(name)` | `Array<Resolv::DNS::Resource::IN::TXT>` — the records themselves | one lookup |
| `DMARCator.txt(name)` | `Array<String>` — every TXT record at `name` | one lookup |
| `DMARCator.dmarc(domain)` | `String` — the DMARC record text, or `nil` | one lookup |
| `DMARCator::Record.lookup(domain)` | `Record` — parsed | one lookup + parse (~0.4 ms) |
| `DMARCator::Record.parse(text)` | `Record` — parsed from a string | parse only |

`DMARCator.txt` is the primitive: unfiltered, in response order, multi-chunk
records joined. It works for any TXT name, including `_dmarc.` and
`_domainkey.` labels, and leaves interpretation to the caller:

```ruby
DMARCator.txt("_dmarc.example.com")
# => ["v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"]

DMARCator.txt("example.com")
# => ["v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com -all", "google-site-verification=abc"]

DMARCator.txt("s1._domainkey.example.com")
# => []
```

Because it returns every record, it is also how you detect misconfiguration
that `DMARCator.dmarc` deliberately hides per RFC 7489 §6.6.3:

```ruby
records = DMARCator.txt("_dmarc.#{domain}").select { |t| t.start_with?("v=DMARC1") }
case records.length
when 0 then :none
when 1 then :ok
else :duplicate  # more than one DMARC record breaks enforcement
end
```

Use `DMARCator.txt_records` when you need the DNS TTL, for example to cache
lookups in a database:

```ruby
records = DMARCator.txt_records("_dmarc.#{domain}")
records.each do |record|
  record.strings.join  # the TXT value
  record.ttl           # seconds the answer may be cached
end
```

All of these accept an injected resolver, and an injected resolver keeps its
own configuration (timeouts are only applied to resolvers the library builds):

```ruby
resolver = DMARCator::Resolver::DoH.new(url: "https://dns.example/dns-query")
DMARCator.txt("_dmarc.example.com", resolver: resolver)
DMARCator.txt_records("_dmarc.example.com", resolver: resolver)
DMARCator.dmarc("example.com", resolver: resolver)
DMARCator::Record.lookup("example.com", resolver: resolver)
```

### Bulk lookups

`DMARCator.dmarc` is the cheapest DMARC path — one lookup, no parsing. For a
scan over many domains:

```ruby
resolver = DMARCator.default_resolver   # build once, not per domain
domains.each do |domain|
  record = DMARCator.dmarc(domain, resolver: resolver)
  # parse only when you need the fields
end
```

Notes for large scans: `Record.lookup` adds a parse per domain (~0.4 ms, far
more than the lookup on a fast resolver); `Resolv::DNS` does not lock per query,
so use one resolver per thread when parallelising; and DoT/DoH open a new TLS
connection per lookup, so plaintext is the better choice for bulk work.

### SPF and DKIM

The TXT primitives also cover the other two records a checker needs. There is
no record-type-specific API, because the semantics belong to the caller:

```ruby
DMARCator.txt("example.com")                # SPF (RFC 7208)
DMARCator.txt("s1._domainkey.example.com")  # DKIM (RFC 6376)
```

Both need the raw list rather than a single value: more than one SPF record is
a `permerror`, and DKIM keys can be duplicated, rotated or revoked (`p=`). A
helper returning "the" record would hide exactly those conditions. DKIM is also
per-selector and selectors cannot be enumerated, so any convenience method would
have to take a selector and would only build the name above.

## Configuration

Process-wide defaults can be set from code, and take precedence over the
`DMARCATOR_DNS` environment variables:

```ruby
DMARCator.configure do |config|
  config.resolver = DMARCator::Resolver::DoH.new(url: "https://dns.example/dns-query")
  config.max_report_bytes = 5 * 1024 * 1024
end
```

A resolver object is shared by every thread, and `Resolv::DNS` does not
serialise concurrent lookups, so threaded applications should configure a
factory instead:

```ruby
DMARCator.configure do |config|
  config.resolver = -> { Resolv::DNS.new }
end
```

`DMARCator.reset_configuration!` discards configured values, which is useful in
tests. Passing `resolver:` to a lookup still overrides both the configured
default and the environment.

## Strict parsing

By default, unknown tags and tags with invalid values are ignored. Pass
`strict: true` to reject them instead:

```ruby
DMARCator::Record.parse("v=DMARC1; p=none; pct=abc", strict: true)
# => DMARCator::InvalidRecord: invalid DMARC tag value: "pct=abc"
```

## Parsing XML reports

Parse a DMARC aggregate/forensic report:

```ruby
report = DMARCator::Report.new(xml_string)

report.version
# => "0.1"

report.metadata.org_name
# => "google.com"

report.policy.domain
# => "opserv.io"

report.records.first.source_ip
# => "209.85.220.69"
```

## DNS transport

By default, DMARC lookups use plain DNS through `Resolv`. Encrypted transports
can be selected with environment variables; no DNS provider is baked in:

```sh
# DNS over HTTPS (RFC 8484)
export DMARCATOR_DNS=doh
export DMARCATOR_DOH_URL=https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
export DMARCATOR_DOH_IP=1.1.1.1          # optional: pin the endpoint

# DNS over TLS (RFC 7858)
export DMARCATOR_DNS=dot
export DMARCATOR_DOT_SERVER=1.1.1.1:853
export DMARCATOR_DOT_SNI=cloudflare-dns.com   # optional: name to verify

# optional, both transports (seconds, default 5)
export DMARCATOR_DNS_TIMEOUT=5
```

Certificates are always verified. `DMARCATOR_DOH_IP` pins the address so the
DoH endpoint does not have to be resolved first; TLS still verifies the URL's
hostname.

Encrypted transports fail closed: a transport failure raises
`DMARCator::ResolutionError` instead of being reported as a domain without a
DMARC record. This applies to every transport, including plaintext —
`Resolv` returns an empty result for NXDOMAIN and raises for timeouts and
other failures, so a failed lookup is never mistaken for an absent record.
Plaintext remains the default because forcing a public resolver breaks private
and split-horizon zones, and some networks block port 853 or public resolvers.

A resolver can also be built explicitly:

```ruby
resolver = DMARCator::Resolver::DoH.new(url: "https://dns.example/dns-query")
record   = DMARCator::Record.lookup("example.com", resolver: resolver)
```

## Stability

The public API is pinned by a contract spec in the test suite: the module
methods, constants and per-class public methods it asserts are the supported
surface. Anything marked `@api private` in the documentation — the parser, the
XML helper, the internal resolver plumbing — may change in a minor release.

### Thread safety

* `DMARCator::Record`, `DMARCator::Report` and the parsed value objects are
  read-only after construction and safe to share between threads.
* The memoized parser and transform are shared, and safe for concurrent use.
* Resolvers are not necessarily safe for concurrent lookups: `Resolv::DNS` does
  not serialise queries. Use one resolver per thread, or configure a factory
  with `DMARCator.configure` so each lookup builds its own.
* `DMARCator.configure` mutates process-wide state. Call it during boot rather
  than per request.

### Deprecations

A method is deprecated in a minor release by documentation only — no runtime
warnings, so nothing is added to application logs. Deprecated methods are
removed in the next major release.

## Security

DMARC records and XML reports are treated as untrusted input. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the reporting policy and scope.

* XML reports are parsed with network access disabled (`NONET`), so external
  entities are never resolved or fetched.
* Reports larger than `DMARCator.config.max_report_bytes` (25 MiB by
  default) are rejected before parsing. Parsing builds a DOM roughly 13× the
  input size, so lower the limit to bound memory:

  ```ruby
  DMARCator.configure { |config| config.max_report_bytes = 5 * 1024 * 1024 }
  ```
* A warning is emitted at load time if the bundled `resolv` gem is affected by
  CVE-2026-80212/CVE-2026-80213.
* Domain names are validated before resolution (labels ≤ 63 octets, total ≤
  248 octets, no leading/trailing hyphens).
* Optional [DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS](#dns-transport) transports verify
  TLS certificates and fail closed: a transport failure raises
  `DMARCator::ResolutionError` rather than being reported as a domain without a
  DMARC record, so a blocked or downgraded lookup can never silently enforce no
  policy. Plaintext lookups fail closed the same way. DoH responses must be
  `application/dns-message` and are capped at 65,535 bytes.

## Requirements

* [Ruby] >= 3.3.13
* [parslet] >= 1.0.0, < 3.0.0
* [nokogiri] >= 1.10

## Testing

To run the RSpec tests:

```sh
rake spec
```

## Releasing

Every published version must have an annotated tag pointing at the commit that
was built, so a gem can always be traced back to its source:

```sh
# 1. Bump VERSION in lib/dmarcator/version.rb and add a ChangeLog entry.
# 2. Commit the release.
git commit -am "Bump version to X.Y.Z"

# 3. Tag that commit before building anything, with release notes in the
#    tag message. Repeating -m adds blank-line-separated paragraphs.
git tag -a vX.Y.Z \
    -m "dmarcator X.Y.Z" \
    -m "Summary of the release, including behaviour changes and upgrade notes." \
    -m "See ChangeLog.md for the itemized list."

# 4. Push the commit and its tags.
git push origin main --follow-tags

# 5. Build and publish from the tagged checkout.
gem build dmarc.gemspec
gem push dmarcator-X.Y.Z.gem
```

The tag message is the release note: it is what `git show vX.Y.Z` prints, so
put the highlight summary and any upgrade guidance there. Write it before step
4, because a pushed tag message cannot be changed without force-pushing the tag.

Tag before publishing, never after: a tag without a published gem, or a gem
without a tag, makes the two hard to reconcile later.

* strict `mailto:`-only handling for `rua`/`ruf` report URIs,
* validation for required and ranged tags (`p`, `pct`, `ri`) and duplicate tags,
* a DNS query path that selects the `v=DMARC1` TXT record per RFC 7489,
* hardened packaging and test fixtures.
