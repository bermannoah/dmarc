### 0.12.0 / 2026-10-29

Breaking changes, taken before 1.0:

* `Report#version` returns the published value as a String instead of a `BigDecimal`, and the `bigdecimal` runtime dependency is gone. A non-numeric version still yields `nil`.
* Parsed report objects (`Report::Metadata`, `Policy`, `Row`, `AuthResult`, `Reason`) are read-only. Their attributes were previously writable, which allowed a parsed report to be mutated into a state that never came from the document.
* `Report.max_report_bytes` now delegates to `DMARCator.config.max_report_bytes`. The class-level accessors remain, so existing callers keep working; `Config#max_report_bytes` defaults to 25 MiB and rejects values that are not a positive Integer or nil.

Other changes:

* `DMARCator::XmlHelper` methods are private to including classes, `Record.truncate_error_message` is private, and `DMARCator::Parser` is documented as `@api private`.
* Add an API-contract spec that pins the public surface of every public class, so additions and removals are deliberate.
* Add `SECURITY.md` and document the stability, thread-safety and deprecation policies in the README.

Migration:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `report.version == BigDecimal("0.1")` | `report.version == "0.1"` |
| `report.policy.pct = 50` | assign nothing; parsed values are read-only |
| `Report.max_report_bytes = n` | `DMARCator.configure { |c| c.max_report_bytes = n }` |

### 0.11.0 / 2026-10-29

* Add `DMARCator.configure` for process-wide defaults, so a resolver can be set from code instead of only through the `DMARCATOR_DNS` environment variables. A configured resolver takes precedence over the environment, and `DMARCator.reset_configuration!` discards it.
* A configured resolver may be a callable, in which case it is invoked for each lookup. This lets threaded applications use one resolver per lookup instead of sharing a `Resolv::DNS`, which does not serialise concurrent lookups.
* Run CI on macOS 15 as well as Ubuntu 24.04, covering the Socket/OpenSSL and Net::HTTP paths used by the DoT and DoH transports.

### 0.10.0 / 2026-10-29

Breaking changes, taken before 1.0 so the release does not carry them:

* Add `DMARCator::Error` as the base class for every error the library raises. `InvalidRecord`, `InvalidReport` and `ResolutionError` inherit from it, so one `rescue DMARCator::Error` catches all three.
* `InvalidRecord` no longer inherits from `Parslet::ParseFailed`, removing the parser implementation from the public exception contract. Parse failures still expose the underlying parser error as their `cause`.
* Remove the deprecated `DMARCator.query` and `DMARCator::Record.query` aliases. Use `DMARCator.dmarc` and `DMARCator::Record.lookup`.
* Rename `DMARCator::Report::Record` to `DMARCator::Report::Row`, so aggregate rows are not confused with `DMARCator::Record`, the parsed DMARC TXT record.

Migration:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `DMARCator.query(domain)` | `DMARCator.dmarc(domain)` |
| `DMARCator::Record.query(domain)` | `DMARCator::Record.lookup(domain)` |
| `DMARCator::Report::Record` | `DMARCator::Report::Row` |
| `rescue Parslet::ParseFailed` | `rescue DMARCator::Error` |

### 0.9.0 / 2026-10-29

* Add `DMARCator.txt_records`, which returns the TXT resource records instead of strings, so callers that cache lookups can read each record's `ttl`. `DMARCator.txt` is now defined in terms of it and behaves the same.

### 0.8.0 / 2026-10-29

* Add `DMARCator.txt`, which returns every TXT record at a name — unfiltered, in response order, with multi-chunk records joined. It accepts service labels such as `_dmarc` and `_domainkey` through a new relaxed `validate_txt_name`, and lets callers detect duplicate DMARC records that `dmarc` deliberately hides.
* Rename the lookup methods after what they return: `DMARCator.dmarc` (was `DMARCator.query`) and `DMARCator::Record.lookup` (was `DMARCator::Record.query`). The old names remain as deprecated aliases and emit no runtime warnings.
* Apply `DMARCATOR_DNS_TIMEOUTS` when the library builds a plaintext resolver, instead of on every lookup. An injected resolver now keeps its own configuration.
* Document the lookup APIs, bulk-scan guidance and deprecations in the README.

### 0.7.0 / 2026-10-29

* Plaintext DNS lookups now fail closed: a lookup failure raises `DMARCator::ResolutionError` instead of being reported as a domain without a DMARC record. Previously a timeout or resolver failure looked like no policy, which failed open. This is a behavior change and applies to every transport.
* DoH responses must use the `application/dns-message` content type (RFC 8484) and are capped at 65,535 bytes.
* `DMARCator::Uri` no longer forwards calls to private methods of the wrapped `URI::MailTo`.
* Remove the unused `XmlHelper#get_int`/`#get_timestamp` helpers and the deprecated `Record.from_txt`.
* Memoize a missing report version instead of recomputing it, and scope spec constants under `DMARCator`.
* Add `changelog_uri` and `documentation_uri` gem metadata, and document that domains must be passed as A-labels.
* Add a CI workflow that runs the specs on the minimum supported Ruby and the current release, loads the gem with warnings enabled, fails on YARD warnings, and builds the gem.

### 0.6.1 / 2026-10-29

* Remove a redundant `attr_reader :sp` that `Record#sp` already overrode, fixing a `method redefined; discarding old sp` warning emitted under `-w` (as CI enables).
* Add tests covering `Record#sp` falling back to `p` when `sp` is omitted.
* Document every report accessor, constant, and public class that YARD previously omitted; documentation coverage is now 100% with no warnings.
* Note the encrypted-transport guarantees in the README security section.
* No functional changes.

### 0.6.0 / 2026-10-28

* Add DNS over HTTPS (RFC 8484) and DNS over TLS (RFC 7858) transports, selected with `DMARCATOR_DNS` (`doh` or `dot`). No provider is bundled and plaintext remains the default.
* Encrypted transports verify TLS certificates, validate the response id, question and TC bit, and follow CNAMEs up to a bounded depth.
* Add `DMARCator::ResolutionError`; encrypted transport failures raise instead of being reported as a missing record.
* Add `DMARCator.default_resolver` and `DMARCator::Resolver.build` for explicit transport configuration.

### 0.5.1 / 2026-10-28

* Point the gem metadata (`homepage`, `source_code_uri`, `bug_tracker_uri`) at the renamed GitHub repository (`dmarc` → `dmarcator`).

### 0.5.0 / 2026-10-28

* Performance: extract each report record in a single pass over its children instead of one XPath query per field (roughly 3x faster `Report#records`).
* Performance: extract report metadata and policy in a single pass.
* Performance: build `Record#reasons` and `Record#auth_results` lazily, so callers that only read scalar fields skip roughly half of record construction.
* Performance: reuse one memoized parser and transform instance, making `Record.parse` roughly 30% faster.
* Add `DMARCator::Report.max_report_bytes` to configure the maximum accepted report size; parsing builds a DOM roughly 13x the input size, so lower it to bound memory.
* Report elements that appear more than once now consistently use the first value, matching prior behavior for records.
* Assign `policy_published` fields explicitly instead of by element name.

### 0.4.2 / 2026-10-28

* Do not raise when the loaded `resolv` version is not a valid gem version; an unparseable version is treated as unknown instead of failing at load time.
* Reject DMARC records larger than 4 KiB (`Parser::MAX_RECORD_BYTES`) before parsing to bound work on hostile input.
* Raise the documented `InvalidRecord`/`InvalidReport` for non-String input instead of `ArgumentError`, `TypeError`, or a silently empty report.

### 0.4.1 / 2026-10-28

* Accept a case-insensitive `mailto:` scheme in `rua`/`ruf` report URIs.
* Fix parsing of `rua`/`ruf` lists that mix valid and invalid URIs.
* Restrict `mailto:` address characters to a safe whitelist.
* Reject underscores in validated domain names.
* Remove the dead Alexa Top 500 scraping task and its fixture.
* Drop the `simplecov` development dependency.
* Housekeeping: remove dead rescue code, fix documentation typos, add frozen string literals, make `Uri` delegation private, and drop the deprecated `gem.test_files`.

### 0.4.0 / 2026-10-26

* Add `strict: true` parsing mode to reject unknown tags and invalid tag values.
* Return `nil` for non-numeric report integers (`count`, `pct`) instead of coercing them to `0`.
* Disable network access (`NONET`) explicitly when parsing XML reports.
* Reject DNS labels with leading or trailing hyphens.
* Set explicit DNS query timeouts.
* Reject XML reports larger than 25 MiB.

### 0.3.1 / 2026-10-26

* Update the gemspec maintainer metadata to list only the fork's author.

### 0.3.0 / 2026-10-26

* Raise `DMARCator::InvalidReport` for malformed XML reports instead of returning an empty report.
* Return `nil` for a non-numeric report `version` instead of raising `ArgumentError`.
* Return `nil` for a non-numeric report timestamp instead of coercing it to the Unix epoch.
* Add `DMARCator::Uri#eql?` and `#hash` for correct Hash/Set semantics.
* Harden `DMARCator.validate_domain` against CVE-2026-80213 (63-octet label limit and 248-octet total limit).
* Warn at load time when the `resolv` gem is affected by CVE-2026-80212/CVE-2026-80213.
* Require Ruby >= 3.3.13 to pick up the Regexp compilation fixes behind GitLab's CVE-2026-89078, CVE-2026-93577, CVE-2026-97229 and CVE-2026-110264.
